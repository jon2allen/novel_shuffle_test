# Batey Shuffle

The Batey shuffle is a variation of the Fisher-Yates algorithm that iterates from the start of the array to the end.

### Bias
**Unbiased**. Like Fisher-Yates, it produces every permutation with equal probability.

### Algorithmic Complexity
- **Time**: O(n)
- **Space**: O(1)

### Potential Use
Same as Fisher-Yates; a standard and efficient shuffling algorithm.

### Timing Results (500,000 integers)
Timing: ~7.6 ms (500,000 integers)
