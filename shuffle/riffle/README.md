# Riffle Shuffle

The riffle shuffle is a common card shuffling technique where the deck is divided into two halves and the halves are interleaved.

### Bias
**Biased**. A single riffle shuffle is far from random. It is mathematically shown that approximately 7 riffle shuffles are needed to randomize a deck of 52 cards.

### Algorithmic Complexity
- **Time**: O(n)
- **Space**: O(n)

### Potential Use
Used in manual card shuffling and simulations of physical card play.

### Timing Results (500,000 integers)
Timing: ~7.9 ms (500,000 integers)
