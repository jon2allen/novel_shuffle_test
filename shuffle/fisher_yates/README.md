# Fisher-Yates Shuffle

The Fisher-Yates shuffle is an unbiased algorithm for generating a random permutation of a finite sequence.

### Bias
**Unbiased**. Every permutation is equally likely.

### Algorithmic Complexity
- **Time**: O(n)
- **Space**: O(1) (in-place)

### Potential Use
Widely used in gaming (shuffling cards), statistics (random sampling), and computer science for any application requiring a fair random permutation.

### Timing Results (500,000 integers)
Timing: ~7.2 ms (500,000 integers)
